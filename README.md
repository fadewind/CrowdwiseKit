# CrowdwiseKit
A Tool Kit for Crowdsourcing Learning.

This project was created by the TSSAI (Trustworthy Secure and Safe Artificial Intelligence) Lab led by Professor Jing Zhang at Southeast University.

The package includes three parts: **Inference**, **Learn**, and **Incentive**.

## Inference
The ground truth inference (label aggregation or label integration) methods for crowdsourced annotation.


## learn
Learn prediction models from the crowdsourced labeled data. The part mainly focuses on end-to-end crowdsourcing learning models.

- MACLU:  Multi-label active learning from crowds. Ref. " Multi-label active learning from crowds for secure IIoT. Ad Hoc Networks. 2021."

## Incentive
The incentive method for federated crowdsourcing.
